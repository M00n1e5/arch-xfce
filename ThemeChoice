After installing XFCE4:

You should already have Git as you have these files. In case you dont, it will be installed with 200.

Run 100-display-manager-and-desktop-v1.sh for LightDM and XFCE4.
reboot and log into XFCE4.

Run 110, 120, 130, 140 and 150 for drivers etc.

Edit and run 200 for software installs from the ARCH repos, edit file and hash out programs you wont use, or add new ones.

To 300 or not to 300... Testing needed. (Maybe new file "NOTINSTALLED...")

Rest locking system from launcher before running 400, if you are happy with lockscreen, hash out the line installing "Slim" from the 400 file before running.

500 - just run it, no editing needed.

600 - Conkys and theming from the ArchmergeD repos. 

700 - More theming, fonts.

800 - Autologin, run if you want autologin to system upon reboots.

900 - microcode fix - run it.
910 - Setting cursor theme.

930 - setting lockscreen theme for Slim if installed. Easy edit with "sudo nano /etc/slim.conf" find "current_theme" near bottom. several themes installed to /usr/share/slim/themes/
Done.

Now, on to manual theming and tweaking:
